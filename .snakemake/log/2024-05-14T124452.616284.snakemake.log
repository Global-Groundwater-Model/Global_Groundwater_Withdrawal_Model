Job 1: now generating /home/sara.nazari/labspaces/global-coastal-groundwater/data/work/Water_Use/Publish_Test/Urban_Mining/Netcdf/GW_depth_less_100m_Urban_mining_grids.nc file from rule Urban_Centre_Mining_Location_GWDepth_100m
Reason: Missing output files: /home/sara.nazari/labspaces/global-coastal-groundwater/data/work/Water_Use/Publish_Test/Urban_Mining/Netcdf/GW_depth_less_100m_Urban_mining_grids.nc

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule Urban_Centre_Mining_Location_GWDepth_100m in line 225 of /labspaces/global-coastal-groundwater/users/sara.nazari/code/Water_Use/Publish/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/sara.nazari/labspaces/global-coastal-groundwater/data/work/Water_Use/Publish_Test/Urban_Mining/Netcdf/GW_depth_less_100m_Urban_mining_grids.nc completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
